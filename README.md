# Beats

This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based website for the Beats product. The website showcases a Beats headphones product, its specifications, case, styles, and purchase options. It is designed to be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes using multiple CSS files targeting various breakpoints.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `style.css` - The main CSS file containing the styles for the website.
- `style@max1200px.css`, `style@max992px.css`, `style@max768px.css`, `style@max600px.css`, `style@max300px.css` - Additional CSS files for responsive design targeting different screen sizes.

## Files Description

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file is structured as follows:

- **Header Section**: Contains the Beats logo, navigation menu, and an overview of the Beats 3 product with an "Add to Bag" option.
- **Main Section**: Displays the product specifications, case information, styles (color options), and buying options.
- **Footer Section**: Includes product links, support, subscription section, social media links, and an option to scroll up.

### CSS Styles (`style.css`, `style@max*.css`)

The `style.css` file defines the primary styles for the website, such as fonts, layout, color schemes, and positioning.

The additional CSS files (`style@max1200px.css`, `style@max992px.css`, etc.) provide media queries for responsive design, adjusting the website's layout based on the screen width.

- **For screens up to 1200px**: Adjustments to header elements, font sizes, and images.
- **For smaller screens (992px, 768px, etc.)**: Further styling adjustments, including smaller font sizes, reduced padding, and image size changes to optimize for mobile devices.

### Key Elements in the Project:

- **Product Overview**: The product page gives an overview of the Beats 3 with a detailed description.
- **Specifications Section**: Lists key features such as Bluetooth connectivity, battery life, fast charging, and microphone support.
